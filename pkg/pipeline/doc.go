// Package pipeline provides a pipeline for processing data.
//
// The pipeline package offers a convenient way to process data using a series of stages. Each stage in the pipeline
// performs a specific operation on the data and passes it to the next stage. This allows for a modular and flexible
// approach to data processing.
//
// One of the key benefits of using the pipeline package is that it manages the flow of data using channels. This
// ensures that data is passed between stages efficiently and without the need for complex synchronisation mechanisms.
// Additionally, the use of channels enables concurrent processing, allowing multiple stages to execute in parallel,
// which can significantly improve performance for computationally intensive tasks.
//
// Another advantage of using the pipeline package is its error handling mechanism. The pipeline will stop on the first
// encountered error, preventing further processing and ensuring that errors are handled gracefully. This makes it
// easier to identify and debug issues in the data processing pipeline.
//
// Overall, the pipeline package provides a convenient and efficient way to process data by leveraging channels for
// data flow management, supporting concurrency, and handling errors effectively.
